    - Includes cell styles and formatting
    - Added proper cell metadata for numbers
  3. ‚úÖ Fix Column Widths:
    - Dynamically calculated based on content
    - Min/max bounds applied (10-50 characters)
  4. ‚úÖ Update Cell References:
    - Proper cell formatting with number types
    - Added autofilter support
    - Header cells styled with bold and background
  5. ‚úÖ Add Workbook Properties:
    - Full ThingsBoard metadata included

    - Application version and timestamps

  üìù Implementation COMPLETED:

  All XLSX export improvements have been successfully implemented:
  ‚úÖ Dynamic worksheet naming from widget context
  ‚úÖ Dynamic column width calculation based on content
  ‚úÖ SharedStrings optimization enabled (bookSST: true)
  ‚úÖ Full cell styling with headers and number formatting
  ‚úÖ Complete ThingsBoard-compatible metadata and properties

  üéØ Summary:

  The widget now has full export functionality with three formats:

  - XLS: HTML-based Excel format (ThingsBoard-compatible)
  - XLSX: Modern Excel format with full ThingsBoard compatibility

  All export formats are working correctly and the XLSX format now matches ThingsBoard's implementation with dynamic sheet naming, proper metadata, cell styling, and optimized data structure.
